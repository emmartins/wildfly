context-service=A context service
context-service.add=Adds a context service
context-service.remove=Removes a context service
context-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the context service.
context-service.use-transaction-setup-provider=Flag which indicates if the transaction setup provider should be used.
context-service.use-transaction-setup-provider.deprecated=Has no effect in a server running the current version. A Context Service configured via the server configuration uses the default ContextServiceDefinition configuration, which is cleared = Transaction (equivalent to use-transaction-setup-provider=true, i.e. any tx in the thread is suspended before and resumed after), propagated = All Remaining, unchanged = none. To use a different ContextService you need to define it on the deployment, through XML or the ContextServiceDefinition annotation.

managed-thread-factory=A managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.add=Adds the managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.remove=Removes the managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the managed thread factory.
managed-thread-factory.context-service=The name of the context service to be used by the managed thread factory
managed-thread-factory.priority=The priority applied to threads created by the factory

managed-executor-service=A managed executor service
managed-executor-service.add=Adds the executor
managed-executor-service.remove=Removes the executor.
managed-executor-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the managed executor service.
managed-executor-service.context-service=The name of the context service to be used by the executor.
managed-executor-service.thread-factory=The name of the thread factory to be used by the executor.
managed-executor-service.thread-factory.deprecated=Deprecated, the executor's thread factory should be configured using attribute named thread-priority.
managed-executor-service.thread-priority=The priority applied to threads created by the executor.
managed-executor-service.hung-task-threshold=The runtime, in milliseconds, for tasks to be considered hung by the managed executor service. If value is 0 tasks are never considered hung.
managed-executor-service.hung-task-termination-period=The period, in milliseconds, for attempting hung tasks automatic termination, by cancelling such tasks, and interrupting their executing threads. If value is 0, which is the default, hung tasks are never cancelled.
managed-executor-service.long-running-tasks=Flag which hints the duration of tasks executed by the executor.
managed-executor-service.core-threads=The minimum number of threads to be used by the executor. If left undefined the \
  default core-size is calculated based on the number of processors. A value of zero is not advised and in some cases invalid. \
  See the queue-length attribute for details on how this value is used to determine the queuing strategy.
managed-executor-service.max-threads=The maximum number of threads to be used by the executor. If left undefined the value \
  from core-size will be used. This value is ignored if an unbounded queue is used (only core-threads will be used in that case).
managed-executor-service.keepalive-time=When the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum time, in milliseconds, that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
managed-executor-service.queue-length=The executors task queue capacity. A length of 0 means direct hand-off and \
  possible rejection will occur. An undefined length (the default), or Integer.MAX_VALUE, indicates that an unbounded queue \
  should be used. All other values specify an exact queue size. If an unbounded queue or direct hand-off is used, a \
  core-threads value greater than zero is required.
managed-executor-service.reject-policy=The policy to be applied to aborted tasks.
managed-executor-service.active-thread-count=The approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks.
managed-executor-service.completed-task-count=The approximate total number of tasks that have completed execution.
managed-executor-service.current-queue-size=The current size of the executor's task queue.
managed-executor-service.hung-thread-count=The number of executor threads that are hung.
managed-executor-service.max-thread-count=The largest number of executor threads.
managed-executor-service.task-count=The approximate total number of tasks that have ever been submitted for execution.
managed-executor-service.thread-count=The current number of executor threads.
managed-executor-service.terminate-hung-tasks=Attempts to terminate the executor's hung tasks, by cancelling such tasks, and interrupting their executing threads.

managed-scheduled-executor-service=A managed scheduled executor service
managed-scheduled-executor-service.add=Adds the scheduled executor
managed-scheduled-executor-service.remove=Removes the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.jndi-name=The JNDI Name to lookup the managed scheduled executor service.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.context-service=The name of the context service to be used by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-factory=The name of the thread factory to be used by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-factory.deprecated=Deprecated, the executor's thread factory should be configured using attribute named thread-priority.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-priority=The priority applied to threads created by the executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.hung-task-threshold=The runtime, in milliseconds, for tasks to be considered hung by the scheduled executor. If 0 tasks are never considered hung.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.hung-task-termination-period=The period, in milliseconds, for attempting hung tasks automatic termination, by cancelling such tasks, and interrupting their executing threads. If value is 0, which is the default, hung tasks are never cancelled.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.long-running-tasks=Flag which hints the duration of tasks executed by the scheduled executor.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.core-threads=The number of threads to be used by the scheduled executor, even if they are idle. If this is not defined or is set to 0, the core pool size will be calculated based on the number of available processors.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.keepalive-time=When the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum time, in milliseconds, that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.reject-policy=The policy to be applied to aborted tasks.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.active-thread-count=The approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.completed-task-count=The approximate total number of tasks that have completed execution.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.current-queue-size=The current size of the executor's task queue.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.hung-thread-count=The number of executor threads that are hung.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.max-thread-count=The largest number of executor threads.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.task-count=The approximate total number of tasks that have ever been submitted for execution.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.thread-count=The current number of executor threads.
managed-scheduled-executor-service.terminate-hung-tasks=Attempts to terminate the scheduled executor's hung tasks, by cancelling such tasks, and interrupting their executing threads.
